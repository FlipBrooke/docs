# Wearable Banana Peels on Head
Did you just emerge from a long disposals ride? Are you a clown with high levels of potassium? What better way to show this off than by placing a banana peel onto your head!

This is a simple proposal that I thought would be a good starting point for me to get into the dev side of SS14! I think it's easy to implement, is simular to existing interactions with items like cones and drinking cups, and would make a small but silly addition for clowns, botanists, tiders, and dispo fans!

## Requirements
- Banana peels can be placed onto a player’s head slot.
- A custom hat sprite will be displayed on the player when this happens.

### I am also considering the following idea(s):
- The Chaplain's Bible won’t heal the player; instead, the game will play a banana slip sound and say something along the lines of *"The Bibles slips off **[PLAYER]**"*.

## Development
I want to try and do this on my own! I have pixel art and programming experience, and think it's a really simple task. Although it's a really small change I would love any suggested features.
